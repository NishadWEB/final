## Bug fix: role was undefined during registration

If a user clicks a link like `/auth/register?role=doctor` the registration form previously *disabled* the role radio input to lock the choice. Disabled inputs are not submitted with the form which caused `req.body.role` to be undefined server-side and prevented doctor registrations from being processed.

What I fixed:
- The backend now passes the `role` query parameter into the template so server-side rendering matches the requested role.
- The frontend still visually locks the role, but now also appends a hidden `input[name="role"]` to guarantee the role value is included in the POST body.
- The server validates that a role is present and shows an error when it's missing.

How to test locally:
1. Start the server (e.g., `npm start` or your local dev command).
2. Open your browser and visit `/auth/register?role=doctor`.
3. Ensure the form shows the role locked and the hidden input is present (you can inspect via devtools -> elements).
4. Submit the form; on success you should be redirected to `/doctor/dashboard` and the database should contain a doctor profile.
