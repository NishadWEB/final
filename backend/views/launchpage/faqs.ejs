                        <p>MediDiag is an online preliminary diagnosis platform that connects patients with healthcare professionals. Patients can describe their symptoms through our guided questionnaire, receive AI-powered preliminary analysis, and book consultations with verified doctors for further evaluation.</p>

                        <p>No, MediDiag is not a replacement for in-person medical care. It's designed for preliminary assessments and non-emergency consultations. For serious medical conditions, emergencies, or when physical examination is required, we always recommend visiting a healthcare facility in person.</p>

                        <p>Our AI-powered preliminary diagnosis is based on medical knowledge and symptom patterns, but it should not be considered a definitive diagnosis.
